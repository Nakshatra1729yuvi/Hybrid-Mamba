# Hybrid-Mamba

## Project Description

Hybrid-Mamba is a Mamba-like Large Language Model (LLM) that combines advanced state-space architectures with transformer mechanisms for efficient and powerful language understanding and generation. This project implements a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of both Mamba and Transformer models.

## Purpose

This repository contains a research implementation of a Mamba-like LLM architecture designed to:
- Provide efficient language modeling with linear scaling
- Combine state-space models with attention mechanisms
- Serve as a foundation for further LLM research and experimentation

## Main Files

- **Hybrid_Mamba+Transformer.ipynb** - Primary implementation file containing the model architecture, training code, and evaluation scripts

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- Jupyter Notebook

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nakshatra1729yuvi/Hybrid-Mamba.git
   cd Hybrid-Mamba
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open and run the Jupyter notebook:
